        "detailed_description": "The Legends of the Bayou DLC dives deep into the bayou's dark heart to initiate the full release of Hunt: Showdown and provide those loyal to the cause with two new Legendary Hunter characters and two unique weapons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo formidable figures are stepping out of the shadows. These exclusive Legendary Hunters take contracts like any other, though their true loyalty remain shrouded in secrecy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first of these is the Bone Doctor, an influential practitioner of voodoo. He has foreseen the evil, which befell the swamp, long before it even arrived. Now that evil has arrived in force, it has learned to fear the doctor's bleached skull visage, and his necklace of prophecy bones that foretells its own downfall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Weird Sister is one of The Bone Doctor's most faithful followers. Once called Cora Beukes, her visage has been obscured by the markings and talismans that guarantee her safe travel through this world and the next. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCopperhead, named for the ubiquitous indigenous snake, is a legendary Nagant M1895. A weapon of distinction, it is only carried by the very first Hunters to reach the bayou, and is all the proof you'll need to show you were here from the start. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlood Oath is inscribed with the family oath of the infamous McGowan twins - “Bound in Blood, Two are One” - a saying that has since been repeated by many long-enduring Hunter duos, and a throwback to an era when all Hunters seemed to fight in twos.",

Many think the fight is only a symbol. But each Spring, Nian marks the turning of the year by coming out to hunt, devouring livestock and shredding human flesh between its murderous teeth. Spring is approaching again, and as local Hunters will tell you, Nian is no symbol; Nian is a symptom - of the Sculptor's influence - and an enemy against which many Chinese Hunters cut their teeth and learn their trade. <br><br>After facing Nian year after year with brutal, bloody success, these two Legendary Hunters immigrated to the United States in late 1895, in spite of the Geary Act, with help from both Trevors and Huff. Their skills would prove invaluable in the fight against the corruption in Louisiana, as well as the weapons and tools they brought with them. In 1896, the Chinese New Year would begin on the 13th: a bad omen for what would happen that year in Louisiana.<br><br><br><strong>North Star</strong> (Legendary Hunter)<br>A student of mythology and a master of the Five Forms, Chen Lan answered the call for aid from the American Hunter's Association, eager to gain knowledge that might aid the fight on her home turf. She keeps silent about the details of her journey from the Fujian province to New Orleans, though her skill with a gun and fondness for violence speaks volumes about the red trail she cut from East to West. <br><br><strong>The Sovereign </strong>(Legendary Hunter)<br>An expert strategist and sniper of otherworldly skill, Xiao Feng left Fujian province with his hunting partner, Chen Lan, crossing the globe in a sweep of bloody encounters over land and sea. Rumors of the duo's deadly skill preceded their arrival in New Orleans, and they were welcomed into the fold of the AHA with reverence befitting the highest nobility.<br><br><strong>Sniper's Gift </strong>(Legendary Nagant Officer Carbine)<br>Before beginning the treacherous journey from Fujian to Louisiana, Xiao Feng's Father - a fellow Hunter - gifted him this Nagant - a symbol of the success he would achieve when he put to use in the bayou. <br><br><strong>Dragon's Song</strong> (Legendary Blank Fire Decoys) <br>When the crackling of burning bamboo is not enough to scare off Nian (or worse), a handful of decoys should do the trick - and this lucky set will work on both brethren and beast in the Bayou.<br><br><strong>Fire Monkey</strong> (Legendary Fusees)<br>According to the zodiac, 1896 was the year of the Fire Monkey, and these fusees were named for the year of their debut in the Bayou.",

The first attempt ended in Monroe gaining the attention of Huff himself, but it was not totally in vain, a shard of window - Pane - scavenged from the floor would become Monroe's signature of sorts. His real escape came during a moment of chaos and confusion, when the warden's infamous Romero - Lock and Key - became his possession. Destitute in the bayou, hunting was his only recourse, and belied a new commitment: to survive and to spite those who'd caused his suffering.",

Ember and Ash, they were called. Figures, seeing as they burned up inside the shack the ten of them lived packed into. All the others made it out. God marked them for the fire with names like that. Turner named his pistols after them. Said every shot was to remind him of them. Keep their memory alive. But I heard it was Turner who started the fire in the first place. Memory, guilt, loyalty.

She told Circe that while many innocent lives were taken in Salem, there was such a thing as a witch. They would parade around in the skins of women and haunt entire towns. They would attract young girls to their side so that when their costumes became too loose with age, they always had something new to slip into. Circe's grandmother told her that it was the job of the Elias family to find these witches and end them, snuff out every single one until there was nothing but rumor and ash left.  <br><br>And so, Circe grew into a fine hunter of witches, ripping them out of the skins of their victims and setting them ablaze so they could return to hell. When the witches were gone, or at least in hiding, someone came to the Elias clan to ask them to join a new cause. While the terror was being controlled in New York, Louisiana's plague was reaching a fever pitch and they needed an Elias for the cause. Her sense of duty and pride in the family name compelled Circe to head to New Orleans and join the Hunt thinking she would be back quickly and praying that her family would be safe until she returned. <br><br>For three months Circe Elias took a Berthier improved with the trophies of witches into the bayou and hunted a new type of monster. For three months she wrote back home to check on her family and tell them of all the sights she'd seen. She wrote of the apothecary she visited everyday with old women who would fill her kit with salves and bandages. And most importantly, she wrote that soon she would be coming back home to bring her little sister Thula to New Orleans. Though the witches had disappeared, this new threat was just as important, and the swamps were the perfect place to train.  <br><br>When Circe finally arrived back home in Salem, she learned an awful truth: The Witches had not disappeared and, worse yet, they had come to her family for revenge. She rushed in only to see the pieces of her mother, father, and brothers. Thula was the only one left, barely alive and skin all gone. Thula only had enough life left to return the Nagant Circe had given her to protect herself and to warn her older sister. The last of the witches had taken Thula's skin and gone to Louisiana to find Circe.  <br><br>As Thula took her last breath Circe decided: She'd go back to New Orleans to stay. She'll continue to hunt the new monsters and wait for the old ones to show up in her sister's skin. Then she'll show them pain so unimaginable that her family will smile down at her from heaven.  <br><br><strong><u>The Witch Hunter</u></strong><br><br>Descended from a long line of witch hunters, Circe Elias was raised ready to fight the unknown. When word got to the New York branch of the AHA about Louisiana, Circe knew she needed to go put her lineage and training to work.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1852480/extras/hunter.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Witch Trial</u></strong><br><br>The Elias family made their money hunting witches in Massachusetts.

When Circe came back to get her, it was still clutched in her cold, lifeless fingers.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1852480/extras/handgun.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Rooted Apothecary</u></strong><br><br>Expertly crafted by the medicine women of Louisiana, this First Aid Kit is said to be the best of both ancient and modern medicine.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1852480/extras/First_aid.png\" />",

Son to revered wolf hunters in Kansas, he watched his mother and father stalk, hunt, and gut the beasts in front of his infant eyes. With each prey brought to the slaughterhouse they called home, the red haze grew and clouded his mind with sanguine dreams. When he held his first small game in crimson hands under the silvery light of the full moon, wolves howled as if to celebrate his rite of passage, unaware of the unholy bloodthirst burning in his heart, and ignorant of the bloodshed he'd bring upon them. <br><br>It was the wolves - not his father - who taught Frisk how to hunt. Envious of their savage nature and hunting prowess, Frisk wanted to prove his worth by taking down the alpha wolf with the Caldwell Pax his father gave him. Successful, he adorned himself with the alpha's skin, and his Caldwell with the fang ripped bloody from its maw and tried to stab his own father in the heart. He would become the mightiest predator in his territory.  <br><br>But in spite of besting the forest's alpha, he could not best his father, and so Frisk disappeared in the night, taking only his father's Caldwell and a Hunting Bow. His bloodlust led him to Louisiana, where he continued hunting, ignorant of the shadows tracking his every move; shadows Hunters in the Bayou would later come to know as Dire Wolf and Luna Wolf; shadows he had once called mother and father.

Bridgewater), a Legendary Caldwell 92 New Army (Honor Above), a Legendary Specter 1882 (Standard Issue), and a Legendary Machete (Arlington Grave). <br><br>Sergeant Caleb Bridgewater felt he was nothing before the uniform; striding out through the badlands with his brothers in arms made him the man he is today. It was not just the inescapable violence that got the better of his nerves, but orders given that didn't align with his own moral compass. Honor became an old feeling, lost amongst the urgent need to avenge fallen friends, desperation in protecting the vulnerable, and realizing that their aspirations were misguided: that they were enforcing an idea of order in a wild land that never asked for it. <br><br>Though Sergeant Bridgewater's performance made him a shining example to others, his postings passed in a haze as he lost himself. He heard what happened to his friends who were discharged, that they were left to struggle with their personal legacies of war. When word reached him of home, and of what had happened in the Bayou, it rattled him back to reality. Letters told of unspeakable horrors and an existential threat to the United States. He urged his men to return to Louisiana, to fight what seemed to be a good fight - a fight he believed it was the nation's duty to undertake. In the end, he walked alone, still wearing the uniform, believing he had chosen the most important war.<br><br><strong><u>Sgt. Bridgewater </u></strong><br><br>The injustice of war caused Sergeant Caleb Bridgewater to seek a different fight when word from home reached him of what was happening in the Bayou. Forced to desert, he's proud now to fight the only war he believes in.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1966460/extras/MicrosoftTeams-image__40_.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Honor Above </u></strong><br><br>Sgt. Bridgewater was surprised to be assigned a new Caldwell 92 New Army - his regiment often got the bottom of the barrel. But Bridgewater's performance in the field was unrivalled, and that came with some recognition.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1966460/extras/MicrosoftTeams-image__41_.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Standard Issue</u></strong><br><br>While the Specter 1882 was standard issue, Sgt. Bridgewater set himself apart with an impressively cool head even when the fighting was close and fierce.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1966460/extras/MicrosoftTeams-image__42_.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Arlington Grave</u></strong><br><br>This blade is older than Sgt.

A testament to his own brand of loyalty, he wields it like a furious Machete, carrying unto his own end.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1966460/extras/MicrosoftTeams-image__43_.png\" />",

Whatever happened, she was driven to find order, to find a way to balance the odds. The rabbit hole she followed led deeper and deeper into a shadowy sect of the AHA that sought to keep the world's unpalatable truths covered. As she passed from success to success, the sect assigned her to straighten out one of their wayward sons, Isaac Powell.  <br><br>Powell, now The Night Seer, impressed Ozols with his vision of a world turned upside down. She grew jealous of his foresight and saw the way to achieve the justice she craved: a way to balance the rightness of actions by both their past and future effects.  <br><br>Ozols gained the Night Seer's trust, and he confided in her the ritual he had undertaken. She repeated it, and as the power coursed through her, it left her blind to the present, but with a powerful and uncanny sense of what was to come.  <br><br>But seeing the Night Seer's path, more vividly than he himself had ever managed, shocked Ozols. She shredded her white robes and dyed them black. The symbols of power she'd once daubed in blood, she bleached again with the light from the corrupted moon, enriching her affinity for Dark Sight. She tied the scraps around her weapons, sure reminders to keep her path true. <br><br>Relying on her heightened perception, familiarity with Dark Sight, and uncanny foresight, Ozols now pursues the Night of the Hunter and any who would work towards their goals. In turn, the Night Seer feels the threat of there being one with greater power than himself, and knows that his prophecy will not come true if another has witnessed it. Now, they are locked in a dark duel, each moving two steps ahead of the other. <br><br><u><strong>The Prescient</strong></u><br><br>Never blind to life's injustices, Ira Ozols trod a dark path towards powers that would let her glimpse what was to come. To make judgements based on the past, and the future.

But in the coming years, their land grew ill, and soon they all followed. Siblings and cousins, aunts and uncles: Maeve helped her mother give them all back to the earth, burying them with their favorite possessions in hand. When Maeve buried her mother, there were no treasures left to harvest, so she placed dried seeds on her cold fingers and prayed they brought her mother bounty in a world beyond. <br><br>Harvest season came again, and from the decaying flesh of her kin, the crops grew fuller and richer than ever before. A ravenous Maeve fed and gorged, and when her gaunt body could take no more, she shared it with the birds, the rabbits, and the deer. <br><br>Maeve kept to herself, and it would be many years before she met another person. When she did, they were people no longer. Disgusted by the greed of the rotting who refused to give back what was no longer theirs, she turned her tools into weapons and left her home behind. Following the scent of death to the Bayou, she readied herself for a different kind of harvest.<br><br><strong><u>Daughter of Decay</u></strong><br>As a child, Maeve Flynn buried her family, and from their rotten flesh grew the crops that allowed her to grow vigorous and sturdy.

In its warm embrace, pain helped Damien fight his remorse and shatter his memories - a blessing bestowed by the Lord himself. But as the years passed, his scars - testimonies to his imperious devotion - grew. Festering wounds stretched across his body like vast mountains, burying his nerves deep beneath thick layers of scab and scar, and one day, his body became numb, and pain, his guide to salvation, abandoned him.<br>Each jolt of pain had been marked by sweat, blood, and his inharmonious moans that had kept his demons at bay, but that night his whip travelled in the air for nothing. A candle's light, too weak to even illuminate the wax underneath, flickered once, then twice, as the whip rose and fell, ripping off skin and flesh, but delivering no pain but disappointment. Shadows danced with the flickering light as if to celebrate their arrival, and the demons, screaming louder than ever, greeted Damien mockingly.<br><br>An anguished moan echoed in his sanctum, a crypt cloistered beneath the St. Francis Seraph Church, and Damien trembled in desperation as his demons resurfaced. Possessed by a need for the scape of pain, he did what he had to do to silence them, wrapping the parts of his body untouched by the whip with barbed wire. But it wasn't enough. Desperate, he skinned his own face and hid it behind a cloth bag dipped in salt. But the ecstasy was temporary. The candle's light died, and with it, hope. He stood in the dark surrounded by his past as memories flashed before his eyes: his wife, chest cut open, face shredded, and hands tied with her own intestines - her eyes fixed on him, as if begging for mercy that is never to come. Behind her, his son, limbs severed from joints, each nailed on a big cross and crudely sewn together, forming a sculpture of flesh, and Damien holding the shotgun he later dubbed Delirium, as a reminder of his sins.<br><br>And through the frenzy of images, a voice spoke of peace, the promise too tempting to resist. With The Scourge in his hand, still dripping his own blood, he took his first step into the AHA branch in Louisiana, and the voices, now harmonious, welcomed him to the Hunt.<br><br><strong><u>The Penitent</u></strong><br><br>Damien Yedaiah buried his past beneath his countless scars, pain helping him to silence his demons. But as his body collapsed and his mind gave way, he found salvation in the blood and pain of others.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2100450/extras/Pentinent_hunter.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>False Sacrament</u></strong><br><br>Damien Yedaiah knew only one method to attain peace: Pain. But his need was too great for his body to withstand, and he concocted this Regeneration Shot to keep his body intact, so his mind could savor the sweet escape of self flagellation.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2100450/extras/regeneration_shot_false_sacrament.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Delirium</u></strong><br><br>Deep in the crypts beneath the St. Francis Seraph Church, Damien Yedaiah sought the sweet embrace of agony - solace from and punishment for what he had done to his own family with this Caldwell Rival 78. Once his demons returned though, he had no other choice but to unearth Delirium once again.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2100450/extras/caldwell_rival_delirium.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>The Scourge</u></strong><br><br>When his body resisted pain, Damien Yedaiah resorted to unconventional methods to keep his demons at bay. He adorned this Nagant M1895 Officer Brawler's handle with barbed wires so he could enjoy the same pain he used to bring to his victims.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2100450/extras/nagant_officcer_brawler_scourge.png\" />",

The first time Claeg realized something was wrong was when he went out on an errand for his wife Emma. He kissed her goodbye and mounted his horse to ride into town, but when he blinked once again, he was five miles away from home and his horse lay bleeding from its throat. He walked all the way back home covered in blood to meet the panicked tears of his wife, children, and friends.<br><br>From then on, it took Claeg every fiber of his being to concentrate even on the smallest task. Doing work on the farm became insurmountable labor, and his children wept in the corners when he mixed up their names and faces. Emma took him to countless doctors who couldn't give a name to his ailment, but any person of the cloth they met all said the same thing: A demon was slowly taking over Claeg's body, and he was in dire need of salvation. “The demon is only sated after sacrifice!” The good Christians would wail. “Stop him before it's too late.”<br><br>But the time to stop Claeg never came. And when he awoke one day to his friend's blood upon his throwing axe, his wails of anguish echoed through the town. It was death that brought Claeg back to life, and so Emma brought him to the man in DeSalle who they knew dealt in death.<br>And death he dealt. Waking to become himself only when blood caked his hands, and his prey took their last breath. Countless has to die so that he, in a sense, wouldn't. So that he remembered the reason he lived this torturous existence. So that he could remember the laughs of his children and the touch of his wife. So that no demon could take his place. <br><br>Claeg Grey donned the mask and robe not for himself, but for the sake of his family. So that no one would know his true self. So that his loved ones could finally find peace once more. And so that he could find clarity in freely administering death. <br><br><strong><u>The Reaper</u></strong><br>Claeg Grey's memory was leaving him. As his mind drifted and became blank, there was one thing that brought him back: Taking someone's life. Desperate to keep him alive, Claeg's family sent him to DeSalle where he could freely reap death.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2133640/extras/fear_reaper_hunter_grimreaper.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Quietus</u></strong><br>After a month or so of success in the Hunt, Emma encouraged Claeg by gifting him a Specter 1882 Compact that she felt fit his new image: Tarnished but powerful.

Though shooting it brings relief, it also brings loss of life, and despair.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2133640/extras/winfield_memento_mori.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>The Scythe</u></strong><br>Claeg's childhood friend Jim Mathis stayed by his side even as the Reaper's memories began to fade.

The stains of which form new filigrees, new intricate inscriptions of death. So too are her stories. Drenched in bloodshed, unrecognizable from their first times told. But they all start the same: a merchant who set sail from an unfamiliar land, sisters bound by twisted fate forced to follow him. The sails limped, the trade winds failed to blow, and the merchant revealed the evil within him. Trapped on still waters, each day of the voyage was marked by new horrors. Alaz witnessed her sisters wither in pain, finding peace only in the cold embrace of the sea. She promised to avenge their misery and unleash the storm. <br><br>At the Port of New Orleans, the rich greeted them as they disembarked. A mansion they had dubbed the Sultan's Palace had been prepared. Food and drinks were plenty, enough to satisfy any gluttonous desire, and melodies from Alaz's homeland joined the rich music in the streets of New Orleans. Debauchery deafened ears and blinded eyes.  <br><br>It was not long until the wind howled, the port waters boiled, and Alaz prepared herself to greet the merchant in his chamber once again, but with Pride's Death in her hand. She carefully tore at muscle and flesh, taking his pride, and leaving him bleeding out on his bed. Her dress bloodied, she joined the guests in the main hall to grant them a quick death with the merchant's precious rifle, Shahmaran. <br><br>When the storm died out in the morning, a river of blood gushed out the Sultan's Palace into the storm-swept streets. The citizens of New Orleans discovered the bodies piled in the hall. And when puzzled minds started asking questions, Alaz had already spent her first bounty on a weapon she dubbed Sister's Anguish. <br><br><strong><u>The Concubine </u></strong><br>As Alaz's reputation grew, her past became a bloody fairytale, her present soaked in blood and mud. She chases a future molded by hatred and vengeance; a future she promised to herself and her lost sisters.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2160020/extras/hunter_concubine.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Sister's Anguish </u></strong><br>When Alaz earned her first coin as a free woman, she bought this Hand Crossbow.

Foulest amongst this pantheon is the creature known as Frau Perchta, unsoftened like others of her ilk by the passing of time. A thing made of fur and tusk, fang and terror, who, in form of a woman, slits the abdomen to pull out the innards. A beast that changes from dusk to dawn.  <br><br>Those that stand against corruption, from forgotten valleys to glacial peaks, are made of harder stuff. Stories reached Louisiana of one - one who'd lost themselves amongst the blood in the snow, and who had donned the mantle of Frau Perchta, inhabited the children's tale meant to terrify.  <br><br>The daughter of a peasant high in the mountains, all that remains of that life are half-forgotten memories of taking the cattle to graze. In midwinter, a father returning home at dusk, a silver coin promised to a good daughter wasted on drink, a hand raised to a protesting mother. A hand raised one too many times. When the sun rose at dawn, a corpse was found with its abdomen slit in two, entrails feasted on by beasts. <br><br>From Louisiana, Perchta was sent for, and only silence answered. Those who had whispered of Perchta were called fools, and those that believed were laughed out of town. But in the depths of winter, when dawn broke in the bayou, garlands of innards were found strung on trees. The bad faced retribution every dusk. An old story was taking on new chapters, and the hunt was growing wilder by the day.  <br><br><strong><u>Perchta: Dawn </u></strong><br>The myths of midwinter recall a time of reckoning: gifts for the good, retribution for the bad. The reckoners, few and far between, have been softened by time. But not Perchta, from ancient alpine valleys, where punishments are dealt with a blade at dusk, and trees gifted with rotten garlands at dawn. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2160330/extras/Hunter_Lady_perchta_v2.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Perchta: Dusk </u></strong><br>In midwinter, the days are short, and it is the dusk and dark that rules over the dawn and light. Perchta only grows more feverous as the days shorten, for in the dark her truest form takes hold, and the light cowers from her fury.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2160330/extras/Hunter_Lady_perchta_v1.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Midwinter Tusk </u></strong><br>Runed with lost symbols of power, the teeth inlaid into this Martini-Henry IC1 belong to no living beast. It's said that at the lightest touch they evoke overpowering illusions of blizzards, avalanches, and children lost to a blanketing white. Ancient memories and inescapable prophecies.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2160330/extras/Martini_henry_Lady_perchta.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Unkempt </u></strong><br>Old stories tell of the terror Perchta would instill on those who'd been bad. Whoever wears the mask of Perchta today deals her punishments out with this LeMat Mark II revolver, using both barrels on the particularly deserving.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2160330/extras/lemat_revolver_lady_perchta.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>The Avalanche  </u></strong><br>When Perchta comes, this Frag Bomb thunders with the force of an avalanche, decimating those in its wake.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2160330/extras/frag_bomb_lady_perchta.png\" />",

The wise warn the curious against being lured by the dancing phosphoresce. But the foolhardy are tempted by stories that la Luz Mala lead to riches and treasures. When those that are want to stray do, the luckiest find old bones and broken pots under the lights. The rest find their graves.  <br><br>The bad lights are strongest on days where rainfall is a distant memory, when canteens swill with dregs, and the earth cracks and gasps. On such a day, years ago, a girl was sent for water. She ignored her elder's advice and strayed towards the lights. She walked until it fell dark, and then further until it became bright. Lost, she spent days on the plain, sucking the moisture out of roots, until a plume of smoke ushered her homewards. At the base of the plume, she only found a massacre. After she buried her family, she saw the lights again on the horizon and set off after them, her despair mingled with a newfound veneration.  <br><br>The ranchers who committed the massacre also knew the legends of la Luz Mala, but did not fear them. They believed them to be some kind of natural luminescence, nothing more. But as the years wore on, and their hair greyed, when they saw the lights, they became more and more uneasy, as if the lights were looking back at them.  Once their uneasiness set in, it soon blossomed into outright terror. Whenever the lights appeared, one of their number would turn up dead. The ranchers began to believe the stories that they were the spirits of the unquiet dead. Some chased the lights, daring them to fight. Others fled, new lights blinking into their path from the depths of the darkened plain.  <br><br>The girl spent too long as the ghost in the glow. She could no longer distinguish herself from la Luz Mala, and though her vengeance was sated, the lights still guided her on. The legend of the bad lights spread, and soon even the bayou was said to flicker with the threat of Luz Mala. <br><br><strong><u>Luz Mala  </u></strong><br>The ghost in the glow, Luz Mala was saved by the bad lights that flickered on the plains of Patagonia. Everything she knew destroyed, those same lights guided her towards her fate. Now, she is the damnation of those who are tempted to stray towards the light.  <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2200640/extras/luz_mala_Hunter.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Raíz Mala  </u></strong><br>The arid plains that saved Luz Mala as she wandered only nourished her with roots. The roots twined round this Caldwell Conversion Chain Pistol serve as a reminder of salvation in damnation.  <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2200640/extras/chain_pistol_raiz_mala.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Del Ojo  </u></strong><br>The further Luz Mala went north, the harder the lights became to spy in the dark, a skill of the eye. Del Ojo is how she named her Vetterli 71 Karabiner Deadeye, taken - with trophies - from another who trod a dark path.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2200640/extras/vetterli_deadeye_seers_gaze_transparent_1.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Premio del Tonto </u></strong><br>Those who dig where Luz Mala are seen should be wary of poison gases at the source.

Whichever he senses will put a room at ease, or compel it to serve his will. The three-faced mask always conceals which way he looks, confusing predator and prey alike until his next move. <br><br>It's a mask that has only been seen once before: worn by a gifted harlequin, who was the leading act of a renowned three-man troupe. The troupe's director kept the harlequin caged between shows, spreading rumors of grotesque disfigurement and urging people to join the audience for a glimpse beneath the mask. The third of the troupe was the bard, who drew people in with songs of sorrow and sympathy for the harlequin's disfigurement, before entrancing that same crowd with accompaniments to the troupe's one-man shows. Many who came to see the plays clamored for a chance to peek at the harlequin's face, trying to confirm the irresistibly horrifying descriptions the rumors spoke of. But no such chance came, and none could ever find what lair the troupe held the harlequin in between shows. <br><br>With the show's success, the director's clothing grew more lavish and the bard's guitar more ornate, yet the harlequin's single costume tore new holes every day. Poverty only added to both the spectacle and pity for the alleged freak, and a freak show proved to draw a greater paying audience than theatre. Then at the peak of the show's success, the director, bard, and harlequin all vanished without trace. Some weeks later, two bodies were found in the canal stripped of their clothes and with faces too grotesque to identify. <br><br>Now, amongst the torment of the Bayou, the troupe's sole survivor christens himself “Scaramuccia”. On the hunt, his finely crafted demeanor shifts and relaxes: relishing not the hunt, but the accursed swamps themselves. Perhaps peeling away the mask would reveal a face less akin to his fellow hunters, and more like what he hunts.<br><br><strong><u>Scaramuccia</u></strong><br><br>Theater twisted this proud performer into a freak show. Now, after a bloody emancipation, he feels at home amidst the monsters of the Bayou, where he can kill for coin instead of begging and pleading for it with a song and a dance.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2272500/extras/commedia_hunter.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Macchinista</u></strong><br><br>A prop and relic from successful street theatre days, this Sparks Pistol has been taken apart and put back together as an elegant weapon -- one that's put to good use burying old memories.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2272500/extras/commedia_pistol_sparks.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Opera Glasses </u></strong><br><br>Spying; seeing without being seen and knowing without being known. Such is the shared nature of theatre and hunting alike. And this graceful, precise Winfield M1873C Marksman separates the two with the pull of a trigger. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2272500/extras/commedia_Winfield_m1873c_Marksman.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Spaccagambe </u></strong><br><br>The stage is set, and it is set with malice.

        "name": "Hunt: Showdown - Biatatá - Still Waters Run Deep",
        "detailed_description": "This DLC contains one Legendary Hunter, two Legendary weapons, and one Legendary consumable: Biatatá (Hunter), Cobra da Várzea (Scottfield Model 3 Spitfire), Proteção do Andarilho (Winfield 1893 Slate), and Língua de Fogo (Liquid Fire Bomb). <br> <br>The following excerpt was retrieved from the short story “Cobra da Várzea”, published in a clandestine local paper from Salvador (Bahia), United States of Brazil (Typewritten translation attached) <br> <br>It's three after midnight, and the only light for leagues comes from the small fire she built in the sand. She works a knife with steady, agile fingers and carefully carves out her prize. When it gives in, it is with a wet sound, and she closes her hand around it like an embrace. At her feet, four men protest in muffled whimpers, facing the night with bleeding holes where they once had eyes. <br><br>When the fishermen find them, they will be dressed in white by the waves of the Atlantic, awaiting final judgment for sins the courts of men had swiftly forgiven. By then, she will be long gone. “It's Biatatá's doing.” The hushed whispers will spread through the streets and the pews. Some will call her a hero, others a murderer, and the superstitious will insist on the stories of a fiery snake stealing men's eyes and driving them mad. Above all, the people will ask, and the papers will plead, why? <br><br>Rolling the fresh eyeball in her fingers, she wonders, not for the first time, if she could ever answer. She never believed in justice, and she can't remember the last time she enjoyed revenge. All she remembers is being small and scrawny and invisible in a crowd of too many. Falling and being used as pavement. Bleeding and being left to rot. She asked why many times, and when the answer came to her, it felt like soothing to a burn. <br><br>Perhaps the reason for one's evil is simply that one can. And if so, then her own reasons could be just as plain. Not a savior nor a beast. She kills these wretched men because she can, and others won't. <br><br>She throws the eye into the flames and takes a deep breath before smiling. Tomorrow, she travels North to colder lands, on the trail of worse evils and tougher choices. But tonight, the salty air of Salvador warms her skin, and as the men's cries fade into silence, she knows these dead will not come back. <br><br><strong><u>Biatatá</u></strong><br><br>Like the legends of Biatatá, Beatriz Ribeiro Valente was a creature of fire trapped underwater. From the beaches of Salvador to the damps of the Bayou, she learned her flames could not be quenched. With nowhere to belong, she rose to set the world ablaze.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2272530/extras/stillwater_hunter.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Cobra da Várzea</u></strong><br><br>The world expected nothing from Beatriz Ribeiro Valente, and when she pounced, they weren't ready. As tales of Biatatá's conquests found their way back to her home in Brazil, her fateful Scottfield Model 3 Spitfire became a symbol of defiance to the downtrodden. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2272530/extras/Stillwater_Scottfield_Spitfire_Cobra_da_Varzea.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Proteção do Andarilho</u></strong><br><br>Although the name Biatatá instils fear in the hearts of many, wanderers travel near water in hopes of her protection. The greedy who disturb an honest journey with lead are bound to be met with a blast from this Winfield 1893 Slate. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2272530/extras/stillwater_Winfield_1893_Slate_Proteção_do_Andarilho.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Língua de Fogo</u></strong><br><br>With a blinding flash, this Liquid Fire Bomb turns still waters into an inferno, and Hunters know the end is near. Running is futile. Fighting is foolish. Close your eyes, and pray Biatatá doesn't catch your scent.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2272530/extras/Stillwater_firebombwater_lingua_defogo.png\" />",

She clung to the bell the night the shrine burned, her family run off, the priests pushed from cliffs. But Ryoko remained. She alone witnessed the ronin who appeared and cut down each desecrator. <br><br>The ronin pulled Ryoko from the temple bell, pressed her ear to a sword, and abandoned her. She could hear a melody in the blade—it sang louder than the bell. <br><br>Ryoko cared for the shrine's ruin, polishing the cinder ribs of torii gates, but the saber's hum turned more brutal—hypnotic, even—until one day she left to silence whatever made it sing. <br><br>Entranced, she endured three trials: <br><br>She crossed a lake frozen with a thousand peering birds. A single glance would lock her soul inside their stilled wings.  <br><br>She navigated ravines of a thousand bones, crawling with a thirst for things beyond water.  <br><br>At last, that which made the blade sing appeared—a crane with a corruption of cicadas spooled from its infested, wounded lungs. The crane lanced her jaw with its bill and prayed. <br><br>“Rejoice, for each new hole is one more place for light to shine through.” <br><br>Ryoko broke the crane's neck. The trees fell silent, and the trance ended. She ventured to the edge of the sea and listened to her blade once more. A new song hummed from the other side of the sunrise, where the water turned black and the hearts of damned men begged for holes and light.<br><br><strong><u>The Miko</u></strong><br><br>The Miko tended her family's shrine long after it fell to ruin. When a sword left in her care began to sing, she followed its melody to Louisiana. She wields the blade to sever the thousand mouths that give it a voice.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2304500/extras/Hunter_onna_musha.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Ochita Mozu</u></strong><br><br>This hama yumi was to never leave The Miko's family shrine. It has been cleansed by shooting a single arrow through the eyes of five birds: one raicho for each step into the shrine she took to reclaim the hunting bow.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2304500/extras/bow_ochita_mozu.png\" /><br><br><strong><u>Shinbatsu</u></strong><br><br>The eyelets of these throwing knives were used to string shimenawa rope to protect The Miko as her shrine burned. When they sink into the chest of a hunter, she still strings them to fulfill their unheard prayers.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2304500/extras/throwing_knives.png\" />",
